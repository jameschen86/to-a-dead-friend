# To A Dead Friend

## By Paul Laurence 

It is as if a silver *chord* were suddenly grown **mute**,

And life's song with its rhythm *warred* against a silver **lute**.

It is as if a silence *fell* where bides the garnered **sheaf**,

and voices murmuring, "It is *well*," are stifled by our **grief**.

It is as if the gloom of *night* had hid a summer's **day**,

And willows, sighing at their *plight*, bent low beside the **way**.

For he was part of all the *best* that Nature loves and **gives**,

And ever more on Memory's *breast* he lies and laughs and **lives**.
