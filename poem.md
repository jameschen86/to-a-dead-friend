#To A Dead Friend

##By Paul Laurence 

It is as if a silver *chord*
Were suddenly grown **mute**,
And life's song with its rhythm *warred*
Against a silver **lute**.

It is as if a silence *fell*
Where bides the garnered **sheaf**,
And voices murmuring, "It is *well*,"
Are stifled by our **grief**.

It is as if the gloom of *night*
Had hid a summer's **day**,
And willows, sighing at their *plight*,
Bent low beside the **way**.

For he was part of all the *best*
That Nature loves and **gives**,
And ever more on Memory's *breast*
He lies and laughs and **lives**.
